Now I want to apply the following fixes and improvements, and also add a new Expenses page:

üîß Fixes to Apply:
Fix CSRF Error

I'm getting a ‚ÄúCSRF token is missing‚Äù error when deleting an order.

Ensure all forms, especially delete forms, include a valid CSRF token using {{ form.hidden_tag() }}.

Fix Order Form ‚Äì Color Selection

Replace the ‚ÄúNumber of Colors‚Äù input with a multi-select dropdown or checkboxes for actual color names:
Black, White, Green, Brown, Beige, Navy, etc.

Store selected colors in the database as a list or comma-separated string.

Fix Product Creation ‚Äì Product Colors

When adding a product, allow choosing available colors for that product (also stored as a list).

This should later be referenced when creating an order (filter colors based on the product selected).

Fix Storage Page Layout

Make the ‚Äú+ Add‚Äù and ‚Äú‚àí Remove‚Äù buttons appear next to each other horizontally, not stacked vertically.

Use a flex layout or inline buttons for this.

Filter Products View by Brand Group

On the Products page, add toggle buttons at the top:

All Products, URBRAND/SURVACCI, and AZIZ

Filter the product table dynamically based on the selected brand group.

Add AZIZ Brand to All Brand Filters

Ensure AZIZ appears and functions across:

Orders page brand filters

Dashboard brand toggles

Export CSV options

‚ûï New Feature: Expenses Page
Add a new Expenses page with:

Three toggle buttons at the top:
URBRAND, SURVACCI, AZIZ

A form to add a new expense:

Expense Name

Amount (EGP)

Date

Notes (optional)

Brand (dropdown or selected toggle)

A table showing all expenses for the selected brand with:

Date

Expense Name

Amount

Notes

A total expense summary at the bottom of the table

Include ability to edit/delete expenses

Add export to CSV for each brand‚Äôs expenses

‚úÖ Maintain clean and consistent UI with the current dashboard style
‚úÖ Use Bootstrap or Tailwind for layout consistency
‚úÖ All changes should persist to the database correctly
‚úÖ Keep using EGP as the currency for all financial records
‚úÖ Ensure all new and updated features are responsive
